# Delay-and-Battery-Degradation-Optimization-based-on-PPO-for-Task-Offloading-in-RSU-assisted-IoV
# Homepage
This is the runnable Python project for the paper 'Edge Computing and Caching Optimization based on PPO for Task Offloading in RSU-assisted IoV'.

Guidance
To run the project, run the .py files in './run_this/运行试验代码'.


'run_weight1_ppo.py' generates the different results under the different weights. Include rewards,
delay,vehicle offloading ratio,average battery degradation cost,battery total capacity,completion ratio  

'run_对比实验  在config1里面要设置一下weight1 = 0.3.py' generates the comparison between different methods.
